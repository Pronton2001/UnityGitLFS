# Pose detection with leap motion controller

A project on pose classification where I use a heuristic approach to count the number of fingers the user is holding. The fingers dataset is drawn directly from the leap motion controller.

The `./fisrt temp/Assets/Script/getInfo.cs` contains my heuristic approaches. It works very nice and smoothly :))

Todo list: 
- [x] Build a mini FPS game.
- [x] Classify the number of fingers using heuristic methods
- [ ] Involve machine learning algorithms for poses classification.
- [ ] Classify more poses shooting, defending, go forward, left, right, jump,...
- [ ] Put machine learning model into the mini FPS game then we have an FPS-hand-controller game without mouse and keyboard.
